# UDF

In SQL, you can create a function using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. The syntax for creating a function varies slightly between database management systems (DBMS) as SQL implementations may differ. Below is a general example that should work in many relational database systems, but you may need to check the documentation for your specific DBMS for any variations.

Here's a basic template for creating a function in SQL:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name (parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...)
RETURNS return_datatype
AS
BEGIN
    -- Function body
    -- Your SQL statements here
    RETURN result;
END;
```

Let's break down the components:

- `function_name`: This is the name you give to your function.
- `(parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...)`: These are the input parameters for your function, each with its data type.
- `RETURNS return_datatype`: This specifies the data type of the value that the function will return.
- `AS`: This keyword introduces the beginning of the function body.
- `BEGIN` and `END`: These enclose the statements that make up the function body.
- `RETURN result;`: This is where you specify the value that the function will return.

Here's a simple example of a function that adds two numbers:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers (a INT, b INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = a + b;
    RETURN result;
END;
```

After creating the function, you can use it in SQL queries like any other function. For example:

```sql
SELECT add_numbers(5, 7) AS sum_result;
```

Keep in mind that the exact syntax and features may vary depending on the database system you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). Always refer to the documentation of your specific database system for accurate information.


# In MySQL

Here's an example of how you can create a simple user-defined function in MySQL. This example function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum:

```sql
-- Create a simple user-defined function in MySQL
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = a + b;
    RETURN result;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

Explanation:

- `DELIMITER //`: This changes the statement delimiter to `//` temporarily. This is necessary because the function body contains semicolons, and changing the delimiter helps MySQL to distinguish between the semicolons within the function body and the final semicolon that ends the entire statement.
- `CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT`: This line declares the function named `add_numbers` that takes two integer parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns an integer.
- `BEGIN` and `END`: These keywords enclose the statements that make up the function body.
- `DECLARE result INT;`: This line declares a variable named `result` of type `INT`.
- `SET result = a + b;`: This line calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to the `result` variable.
- `RETURN result;`: This line specifies the value that the function will return.
- `DELIMITER ;`: This resets the statement delimiter to the default semicolon.

After creating the function, you can use it in SQL queries. For example:

```sql
SELECT add_numbers(5, 7) AS sum_result;
```

This should return the result `12`.


***Error Code: 1418. This function has none of DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA in its declaration and binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)**



The error you're encountering is related to MySQL's requirement for functions to be marked as either DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA. This is important for MySQL when binary logging is enabled.

To resolve this issue, you can explicitly declare the nature of your function. For example, if your function is deterministic (meaning it always produces the same result for the same input), you can declare it as such. If your function doesn't read or write data, you can declare it as NO SQL. If it only reads data, you can declare it as READS SQL DATA.

Here's an example where I assume your function is deterministic:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = a + b;
    RETURN result;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, I added `DETERMINISTIC` to the function declaration. If your function is not deterministic or if it reads or writes data, you might need to adjust accordingly.

If you want to allow less safe behavior, as suggested in the error message, you can set the `log_bin_trust_function_creators` variable. However, be cautious with this approach, as it might have security implications. You can set it like this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
```

Remember that changing global settings might require higher privileges and should be done with caution. Always consider the security implications before making such changes.
