# Clause

SQL provides various types of clauses that allow you to specify conditions, filter, and manipulate data in your database queries. Here are some of the most common SQL clauses with explanations and examples:

1. **SELECT Clause**:

   The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns you want to retrieve from a table.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
   ```
2. **FROM Clause**:

   The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which you want to retrieve data.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders;
   ```
3. **WHERE Clause**:

   The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on a specified condition.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE price > 100;
   ```
4. **GROUP BY Clause**:

   The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;
   ```
5. **HAVING Clause**:

   The HAVING clause filters the results of a GROUP BY query.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
   ```
6. **ORDER BY Clause**:

   The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
   ```
7. **JOIN Clause**:

   The JOIN clause is used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
   FROM customers
   INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```
8. **LIMIT Clause**:

   The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned in the result set.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
   ```
9. **OFFSET Clause**:

   The OFFSET clause is often used with the LIMIT clause to skip a specified number of rows before starting to retrieve rows.

   Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
   ```
10. **DISTINCT Clause**:

    The DISTINCT clause is used to retrieve unique values in a specified column.

    Example:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;
    ```
11. **UNION Clause**:

    The UNION clause is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

    Example:

    ```sql
    SELECT product_name FROM products
    UNION
    SELECT service_name FROM services;
    ```
12. **WITH Clause (Common Table Expression, CTE)**:

    The WITH clause defines a temporary result set that can be referred to within a subsequent SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

    Example:

    ```sql
    WITH high_salary_employees AS (
        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
    )
    SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;
    ```

These are some of the most commonly used SQL clauses that help you retrieve and manipulate data from your database. SQL queries often involve a combination of these clauses to achieve the desired results.


# Order Of Clauses

The order in which SQL clauses should be used in a SQL query is generally as follows:

1. **SELECT Clause** - Start by specifying the columns you want to retrieve.
2. **FROM Clause** - Specify the table(s) from which you want to retrieve data.
3. **JOIN Clause** - If you need to combine data from multiple tables, use the JOIN clause to define the relationships between the tables.
4. **WHERE Clause** - Apply filtering conditions to limit the rows returned.
5. **GROUP BY Clause** - If you want to group rows based on certain column values.
6. **HAVING Clause** - Use the HAVING clause to filter grouped results.
7. **ORDER BY Clause** - Sort the results in ascending or descending order.
8. **LIMIT Clause** - Limit the number of rows returned, often used with OFFSET for pagination.
9. **OFFSET Clause** - If you are implementing pagination, you can specify an offset to skip a certain number of rows.
10. **DISTINCT Clause** - If you want to retrieve unique values, use the DISTINCT clause.
11. **UNION Clause** - Combine results from multiple SELECT statements.
12. **WITH Clause (Common Table Expression, CTE)** - Define temporary result sets that can be used in the main query.

Please note that not all queries will include all these clauses, and their order can vary depending on the specific requirements of your query. In general, you start with the SELECT and FROM clauses and then add other clauses as needed to filter, manipulate, and organize your data. The choice of clauses and their order in your SQL query will depend on your specific use case.
