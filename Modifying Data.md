In SQL, We	 can perform various data modification operations to add, update, and delete records in a database. These operations are typically done using the following SQL statements:

1. **INSERT** - Adding Data:

   The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records (rows) into a table.

   Example:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, job_title, salary, hire_date)
   VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Manager', 60000.00, '2023-10-31');
   ```
2. **UPDATE** - Modifying Data:

   The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table based on a condition.

   Example:

   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET salary = 65000.00
   WHERE employee_id = 1;
   ```

   This query updates the salary of the employee with `employee_id` 1.
3. **DELETE** - Removing Data:

   The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table based on a condition.

   Example:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 2;
   ```

   This query deletes the employee with `employee_id` 2.

These are the fundamental data modification operations in SQL. Make sure to exercise caution when using these statements as they can permanently change or remove data from your database. Always have backups and perform these operations with a clear understanding of the consequences.

Here's a reminder to use the appropriate SQL constraints and take precautions to maintain data integrity, such as using transactions, to ensure the consistency of your data when performing these operations.
